# RNAseq
Code for RNAseq

This repository contains work in progress code for RNAseq developed at CNB-CSIC in the Scientific Computing Service.

Mostly, it contains EasyDA (a command-line program for RNAseq analysis) and the tools we are working on for further data analysis which will eventually be moved into EasyDA.

At some point, EasyDA will be moved to its own repository and this one kept only for work in progress.

All code is released under EU-GPL o(the European GNU Public License)
