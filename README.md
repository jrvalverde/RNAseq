# RNAseq
Code for RNAseq

This repository contains code for RNAseq developed at CNB-CSIC in the Scientific Computing Service.

Mostly, it contains EasyDA (a command-line program for RNAseq analysis) and the tools we are working on for further data analysis which will eventually be moved into EasyDA.
